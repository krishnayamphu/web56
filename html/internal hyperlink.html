    <h2 id="computer">Computer</h2>
    <p>
        A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical
        operations
        (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
        These
        programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally
        complete
        computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for
        full
        operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or
        computer
        cluster.

        A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems, including simple
        special-purpose
        devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots. Computers are at
        the core
        of general-purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power
        the
        Internet, which links billions of computers and users.

        Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have
        aided people
        in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were
        built to
        automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did
        specialized
        analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed
        during
        World War II, both electromechanical and using thermionic valves. The first semiconductor transistors in the
        late 1940s
        were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies
        in the
        late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and
        versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at
        a rapid
        pace (Moore's law noted that counts doubled every two years), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late
        20th to
        early 21st centuries.

        Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing
        unit (CPU)
        in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory
        chips. The
        processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change
        the order
        of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice,
        joystick,
        etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions
        (e.g., the
        2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they
        enable the
        result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

    <p>Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with
        fingers.
        The earliest counting device was most likely a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the
        Fertile
        Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, likely livestock or
        grains,
        sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[a][4] The use of counting rods is one example.


        The Chinese suanpan (算盘). The number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408.
        The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in
        Babylonia as
        early as 2400 BCE. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval
        European
        counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to
        certain rules,
        as an aid to calculating sums of money.[5]


        The Antikythera mechanism, dating back to ancient Greece circa 150–100 BCE, is an early analog computing device.
        The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, according to Derek J.
        de
        Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the
        Antikythera wreck
        off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to approximately c. 100 BCE.
        Devices
        of comparable complexity to the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteenth century.[7]

        Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The
        planisphere was a star chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.[8] The astrolabe was
        invented
        in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A
        combination of
        the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several
        different
        kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[9][10] and
        gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[11] Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first
        mechanical
        geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe,[12] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[13] with a gear train
        and
        gear-wheels,[14] c. 1000 AD.

        The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and
        division,
        and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found
        application
        in gunnery, surveying and navigation.

        The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a
        mechanical
        linkage.


        A slide rule
        The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630 by the English clergyman William Oughtred, shortly after the
        publication of
        the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As
        slide rule
        development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as
        well as
        transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other
        functions.
        Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B
        circular
        slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.</p>

    <h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
    <p>
        The term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects. Circuits, computer
        chips,
        graphic cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and
        "mice"
        input devices are all hardware.

        A general-purpose computer has four main components: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control unit, the
        memory, and
        the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by buses, often made of
        groups of
        wires. Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned
        off or on
        by means of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents a bit (binary digit) of information so that when the
        circuit
        is on it represents a "1", and when off it represents a "0" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are
        arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other
        circuits.

    <h2 id="software">Software</h2>
    <p>Software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form, such as programs, data, protocols,
        etc.
        Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in
        contrast to
        the physical hardware from which the system is built. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries
        and
        related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. It is often divided into system
        software and
        application software. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on
        its
        own. When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC
        compatible
        computer, it is sometimes called "firmware".</p>

        The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be
        programmed. That is to say that some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it
        will
        process them. Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an
        imperative programming language. In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend
        to many
        millions of instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example. A typical modern
        computer
        can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of
        operation.
        Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write,
        and due
        to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

        Stored program architecture
        Main articles: Computer program and Computer programming

        Replica of the Manchester Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program computer, at the Museum of Science
        and
        Industry in Manchester, England
        This section applies to most common RAM machine–based computers.

        In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to
        another,
        send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's memory and are
        generally
        carried out (executed) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell
        the
        computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there.
        These are
        called "jump" instructions (or branches). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so
        that
        different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some
        external
        event. Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that "remembers" the location it
        jumped
        from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.

        Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in
        sequence,
        they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest.
        Similarly, a
        computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again
        until some
        internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the
        computer to
        perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.
